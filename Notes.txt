MVC

Model => Data representation for the view

View => HTML + CSS + JS + Razor 

Controller => Movies

Http Requests

GET => 
PUT => 
POST => 
DELETE =>

You create entites based on requirement of databsae tables
you create models based on requireemnt of View


HomeController controller = new HomeController(new Logger(), new MovieService());
controller.Index();
Method(int x, IMovieService service);
Method(5, new MovieService() )
Partial Views are useful so that we can re use them across multiple views

EF  Core Code First approach

1. Install EF Core tools 
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/cli/dotnet
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
dotnet tool update --global dotnet-ef

2. Install Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer in Infra and MVC projects
3. Install Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design in MVC
4. Create a class inherits from DbContext => represents your Database
5. Create a connection string which EF Core is going to use to access the database
    should include server name, Database Name and any credentials
